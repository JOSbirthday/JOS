        AncientJavasJOS:You know ■■■ right? He was acting weird today, kept
        asking me about some package<br />
        [REDACTED][NULL]:How is that weird? What package anyway?<br />
        AncientJavasJOS:I don't really know, we don't speak as much anymore<br />
        AncientJavasJOS:And the package is just a mystery to me<br />
        [REDACTED][NULL]: Why don't you talk as much? You mad at him?<br />

        [REDACTED][NULL]:Maybe you should go to the postal office, you gotta
        pick it up?<br />
        AncientJavasJOS:Thats pretty far-fetched, he would say it if i did have
        to.<br />
        AncientJavasJOS:And besides, whats the point of paying for the postal
        service if he could just deliver it to me<br />
        [REDACTED][NULL]:I still think you should check.<br />
        AncientJavasJOS:Why? If he got me the package via mail hes dumb<br />
        [REDACTED][NULL]:Don't say that, he isn't dumb.<br />
        [REDACTED][NULL]:And besides, he does live on the other side of town.
        Maybe its easier<br />
        AncientJavasJOS: How do you know where we live?<br />
        [REDACTED][NULL]:You told me. On that call? Few months ago.<br />
        AncientJavasJOS:Really? I don't remember? <br />
        [REDACTED][NULL]:I think you should just go check it out.<br />
        [REDACTED][NULL]:Im interested in whats in that package.<br />
        AncientJavasJOS:Jeez fine i'll go.I'll hit you up when i get it.<br />

        [REDACTED][NULL]:Anything on that package?<br />
        AncientJavasJOS:Yeah, i didn't pick it up yesterday, i thought it would
        be more efficient if i got it today.<br />
        AncientJavasJOS:And you were right, he went up to me, asked me about it,
        and told me i should check the postal office<br />

        eavesdropping on you.<br />
